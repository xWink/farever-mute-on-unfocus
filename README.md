# Farever Mute When Unfocused

A small unofficial [HLX](https://github.com/hlx-framework/hlx-core) mod for **Farever** that lowers or mutes the game's own audio when the Farever window loses focus and restores the previous volume when you return to the game.

It only changes Farever's internal FMOD master VCA (`vca:/MASTER`). It does **not** change the Windows volume mixer or mute other applications.

## Installation

### 1. Install HLX Core

Install HLX Core from Nexus Mods:

https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/2118?tab=files&file_id=8998

Extract it into your Farever game directory. A typical Steam install path is:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Farever\
```

After HLX is installed, the Farever directory should contain `libhl64.dll` and an `hlx` folder.

### 2. Install the Farever ImGui plugin

The settings menu requires the Farever ImGui plugin:

https://www.nexusmods.com/farever/mods/4

Install it according to the plugin's instructions. The important native plugin file should end up here:

```text
Farever\hlx\plugins\imgui64.hdll
```

The plugin may also include its supporting `imgui\fonts` folder under `hlx\plugins`.

Do not place `imgui64.hdll` loose beside `Farever.exe`.

### 3. Install this mod

Create this directory if it does not already exist:

```text
Farever\hlx\mods\mute-unfocused\
```

Place `mute-unfocused.hl` here:

```text
Farever\hlx\mods\mute-unfocused\mute-unfocused.hl
```

The final layout should look roughly like:

```text
Farever\
├── libhl64.dll
└── hlx\
    ├── plugins\
    │   ├── imgui64.hdll
    │   └── imgui\
    │       └── fonts\
    └── mods\
        └── mute-unfocused\
            └── mute-unfocused.hl
```

Fully close and relaunch Farever after installing or replacing the mod.

## Using the settings menu

The settings menu opens automatically the **first time** the mod is run so the player can see the available options. After it has been shown once, it stays closed on future game launches unless you reopen it manually.

The default menu hotkey is:

```text
F9
```

Press **F9** at any time while Farever is focused to reopen the **Mute on Unfocus** window. The window can be closed with its **X** button.

The menu contains:

- **Enable** — turns the unfocused-audio behavior on or off.
- **Background volume %** — sets Farever's volume while the game is unfocused. The default is **0%**, which fully mutes the game.
- **Change hotkey** — click this, then press the key combination you want to use to reopen the menu.

Hotkeys can use a normal keyboard key by itself or combinations with **Ctrl**, **Shift**, **Alt**, and **Win/Super**. For example:

```text
Ctrl + Shift + F9
```

While changing the hotkey, hold the modifier keys first and then press the main key. Press **Esc** to cancel without changing it.

Settings are saved automatically to:

```text
Farever\hlx\mods\mute-unfocused\config.json
```

## How it works

The mod hooks `GameApp.update` through HLX and watches Farever's `hxd.Window.isFocused` state.

When focus changes:

- **Focused → unfocused:** read the current Farever master VCA volume and apply the configured background volume.
- **Unfocused → focused:** restore the saved master VCA volume.

Because this is done through Farever's FMOD API, other Windows applications are unaffected.

## Building from source

Prerequisites:

- Haxe 4.3.x (tested with Haxe 4.3.7)
- HLX runtime (`hlx-runtime`)
- Farever `hl-imgui`

Install the Haxe dependencies:

```text
haxelib git hlx-runtime https://github.com/hlx-framework/hlx-core.git main hlx-runtime/src
haxelib git hl-imgui https://github.com/laymain/farever-mods.git main imgui/hl-imgui/src
```

Then run from the repository root:

```text
haxe compile.hxml
```

The output is:

```text
build/mute-unfocused/mute-unfocused.hl
```

The repository includes a minimal `h3d.impl.DX12Driver` compile-time wrapper so this mod can build without distributing Farever's proprietary generated game library.

## Compatibility

This mod is tied to Farever's internal API and the current HLX/ImGui integration. Game or framework updates can break the hook or native UI integration and may require a rebuild.

If Farever stops launching after an update, remove:

```text
Farever\hlx\mods\mute-unfocused\
```

and relaunch the game.
